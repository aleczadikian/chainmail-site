# Chainmail

## Intro
In the late 90s and early 00s, you may have experienced chain email, a message originating from a random person that's been forwarded many times to reach you. It could either be exciting or bothersome, and you could really only blame whoever forwarded it to you. We're bringing that back in a slightly more modern way.

## Howto
You start by connecting to users you know, or even just one fairly active user. You can start a message or forward one from your inbox, to be sent to all your connections. Connections are mutual, meaning you cannot only follow someone who doesn't respond, but you don't need many connections to fill your inbox with messages from all over. As you check your inbox, we encourage you to forward anything you like so the chain can continue!

## Privacy & Terms of Service:
1. This is not a private messaging app. We take security seriously, but messages are meant to be public in nature, and we don't make guarantees about their privacy.
2. What you're not allowed to send in messages:
    a. Spam, scams, and exploits.
    b. Anything illegal or depicting illegal activity. This includes inciting crime or violence and spreading whatever can obviously be considered slander.
3. Your data:
    a. You don't give us (nor do we collect) any personal data except your Chainmail username, which will be redistributed. Don't make it anything sensitive.
    b. We don't plan to look at or distribute your messages unless they're reported, but we make no guarantees here because of point #1.
