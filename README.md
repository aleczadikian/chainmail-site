# Chainmail

## Intro
In the late 90s and early 00s, you may have experienced chain email, a message originating from a random person that's been forwarded many times to reach you. It could either be exciting or bothersome, and you could really only blame whoever forwarded it to you. We're bringing that back in a slightly more modern way.

## Howto
You start by connecting to users you know, or even just one fairly active user. You can start a message or forward one from your inbox, to be sent to all your connections. Connections are mutual, meaning you cannot only follow someone who doesn't respond, but you don't need many connections to fill your inbox with messages from all over. As you check your inbox, we encourage you to forward anything you like so the chain can continue!

## Rules Overview:
You bear responsibility in the messages you compose, but you are equally reponsible for the messages you forward. We will promptly remove any messages violating these rules, and the creator and all forwarders will have their accounts terminated. A reporting mechanism is in place to bring such messages to our attention, and you may disconnect from users posting offending content.
Illegal and objectionable content are strictly forbidden. This includes everything the App Store disallows, such as:
- Bullying, threats, slander, and other forms of verbal harassment.
- Sexual or pornographic content. Other repulsive content, such as overly detailed violence.
- Content meant to offend based on race, religion, origin, gender, or sexual orientation.
- Spam, scams, and other content intended to mislead users or cause harm.
- Illegal activity, including illegal trade, intellectual property infringement, and recruitment into illegal organizations.
- Encouragement of illegal or dangerous activity, such as animal abuse or unsafe handling of weapons.

## Privacy Overview:
1. This is not a private messaging app. We take security seriously, but messages are meant to be public in nature, and we don't make guarantees about their privacy.
2. Authentication is done by a third party (Firebase) and uses your email address, phone number, and possibly other information for authentication purposes only. We may read such information while responding to support requests but won't distribute it outside. Other than that, you don't give us (nor do we collect) any personal data except your Chainmail username, which will be redistributed. Don't make it anything sensitive.
3. We don't plan to look at or distribute your messages unless they're reported, but we make no guarantees here because of point #1.
4. Anonymous usage-related data may be collected. This is described in greater detail in the EULA.
